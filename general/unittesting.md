# Unit Testing

Unit testing is required, for any significant project.

Travis CI should be used for open source projects which have unit tests. On these projects, the Travis "badge" must be displayed at the top of the project's readme, below the title.

For closed-source projects, ping devops about getting a setup on our Jenkins server.
