# Unit Testing

Unit testing is encouraged, especially on repositories whose development intends to continue for a long period of time or mission-critical projects. Travis CI is available and should be used for projects which have unit tests. On these projects, the Travis "badge" must be displayed at the top of the project's readme, below the title.
