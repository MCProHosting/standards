# Code Style

The website [codeguide.co](http://codeguide.co/) is a great guide, which is followed by Twitter Bootstrap (among others). However, we prefer to use four spaces for soft tabs rather than two, for greater readability.

It's usually acceptable to use ejs templates for static websites, and compiling it to take advantage of partials, loops, and the like.
